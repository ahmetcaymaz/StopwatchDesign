# StopwatchDesign
Design, and implement a Stopwatch on the Basys3 FPGA board. You display milliseconds using first digit, display seconds using 2 digit (2th and 3th), and display minutes using last digit of the seven segment display. Initially, it should work like a regular stopwatch, but when we press the BTNC button it should start counting down.

Inputs:
reset: You should use BTND button to reset stopwatch.
start/stop: We use SW5 switch to start and stop stopwatch.
up/down: We use BTNC button to count up or down.
